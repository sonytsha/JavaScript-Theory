let & const declarations are hoisted

console.log(b); --- undefined value
console.log(a); =----- error
let a = 10;
var b = 100;
console.log(a); ----- 10

for let and const they are stored in a separate memeory space, not in global, u cant access them before putting any value

temporaral dead zone - the time when its hoisted/assigned but not being initialized or not put any value
whenver u try to access variable in temporal dead zone, u get error
it cant be accessed in temporal dead zone

window.b -- 10
window.a -- undefined
coz let and const dont store in window

we cant duplicate with let
let a =10;
let a =100;
it will show error
redeclaration is not psble with let 

let a =10;
var a=100;
it will show error
once in let, u cant redeclare it

in const :
const b = 1000;


u can do : let a;
a=10;
console.log(a);

but u cant do this with const: 
const b;
b=10;
this will throw error --- syntax error , 

whenever const is there, u will need to declare in the same line

const b =100;
b=10; -----it will throw type  error
