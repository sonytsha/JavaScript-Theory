Everything in JS happens inside an "Execution Context"

2 components : 

1) memory : key : value 
a : 10
fn :{...}
also known as "variable environment"
all the variable , functions are stored as key value pair

2) code component : 
where code is executed one at a time
also known as "thread of execution"

JS is a synchronous single-threaded language

1 command at a time and only go to next line once the current execution has been done
